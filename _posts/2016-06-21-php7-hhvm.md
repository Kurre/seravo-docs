## Alternative PHP Engines

By default, WP-palvelu.fi uses the PHP 5.6.x line as its PHP driver because it is widely supported in the WordPress community and the vast majority of plugins will work with it.

### HHVM

For a performance boost we have for a long time already offered the option of using the [Facebook's Hip Hop Virtual Machine (HHVM)](http://hhvm.com) instead of PHP as the WordPress driver. HHVM is a massive improvement over PHP 5 in speed, but sometimes suffers from stability and compatibility issues.

### PHP 7
We now offer a third option: [PHP 7](http://www.zend.com/en/resources/php-7), which is an evolution of Zend's PHP 5, and is comparable in speed to HHVM.

In addition to performance improvements, PHP 7 has also brought some minor changes to the PHP syntax, which might break some plugins. Most of the time it will work just fine with WordPress though.

## How to enable HHVM or PHP 7

Enabling PHP 7 or HHVM in WP-palvelu.fi is remarkably easy. Just add a line to your nginx conguration in `/data/wordpress/nginx/custom.conf`

For PHP 7:

```
set $mode php7;
```

For HHVM:

```
set $mode hhvm;
```

Remember to reload nginx configuration afterwards with `wp-restart-nginx`.

You can follow the same intructions both in our Vagrant box, and on the live servers. When you make the nginx configuration part of your development repository, all your development, staging and production enviroments will use the same PHP back-end across the board.

Have fun using next generation PHP Engines at WP-palvelu.fi!
