## What is xDebug?

xDebug is debugger and profiler for PHP. We mainly use it as profiler and it's installed in vagrant box by default.

## Profiling pages with xDebug and webgrind

You can profile any page in Vagrant by visiting them and using `?XDEBUG_PROFILE` paramater in the url.

This will generate new dbkg dump which you can the analyze using in your browser using webgrind.

### Example: Profile WP admin dashboard
1. Visit: http://wordpress.local/wp-admin/?XDEBUG_PROFILE
2. Visit http://webgrind.wordpress.local/
3. Click **update** button and wait for webgrind to analyze the dump.
4. You can see the profiling of the admin page and lookup slow functions which you can optimize.
