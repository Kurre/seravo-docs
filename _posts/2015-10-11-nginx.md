## Background
Traditionally php hosting sites (and WordPress) have been using Apache as a Web Server. In the last few years many have migrated from Apache to [Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/docs/). Nginx is faster and in our opinion even easier to configure than Apache is.

## Default settings
We have already done the configuration for you so usually you don't need to do anything. By default we have included:

* Strong https settings ([see example](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=wp-palvelu.fi&s=185.26.50.22))
* Proxy cache with [stale cache](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_cache_use_stale)
* Gzipping all contents
* Long expiration headers for static content
* Option to use [pagespeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/) module. (But you have to turn it on)

These alone will make your site more secure and multiple times faster than typical hosting.

## Configuration

In Apache you had **.htaccess** file for adding custom rules to your web server. This was slow and error prone because the same rules we're loaded in apache for every pageview. Your project includes nginx customisation file in:

```
/data/wordpress/nginx/custom.conf
```

These additions are included in nginx **server** block:

```nginx
server {
  listen 80 default_server;
  server_name your-site.com;
  ...

  include /data/wordpress/nginx/*.conf;

  ...
}
```

If you don't need these additions it's safe to delete them.

## Examples
The default file: ```/data/wordpress/nginx/custom.conf``` includes some examples to start with which have just been commented out. If you can't find what's your looking for please contact the support. [Or edit this page](#edit-this-page).

### How to force https
Because we are using cache proxy which does the ssl termination the default nginx rules won't work here.

Instead use our custom variable:

```nginx
# Force redirect http->https
set $force_https 1;
```
**Note:** You need purchase ssl certificate from WP-Palvelu in order to do this. We'll install and configure it for you.

### Redirects

#### Basic redirect
Redirects from http://your-site.com/original -> http://example.com/new/url/

```nginx
rewrite ^/original http://example.com/new/url/ permanent;
```

#### Redirect only certain domains
If you have multiple domains for your site and want to only use one of them:

```nginx
if ($host ~ "old-subdomain.your-old-site.com") {
  rewrite ^ http://your-site.com$request_uri permanent;
}
```

#### Redirect subdomain to subdirectory

```nginx
if ($host ~ 'subdomain.your-site.com') {
  rewrite ^ http://your-site.com/subdirectory/another-directory/;
}
```

### Pagespeed module
Pagespeed enhances sniffs your html documents and rewrites them to be faster. This is very site dependent so test everything carefully before putting it into production. You can find all filters in [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/filters).

#### Turn pagespeed on
```nginx
pagespeed on;
```

#### Add some pagespeed filters
```nginx
# This does a lot so test which of these you really need
pagespeed EnableFilters rewrite_css,sprite_images,combine_css,inline_css,flatten_css_imports,inline_javascript,combine_javascript,inline_google_font_css,canonicalize_javascript_libraries,rewrite_images,recompress_images;
```
