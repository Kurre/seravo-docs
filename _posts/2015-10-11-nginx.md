summary: "WP-palvelu.fi heavily utilises Nginx in both our WordPress environment and routing layer. Here's a short description of our Nginx use"
---

## Background
Traditionally, most hosting sites have been using Apache, bundled with PHP as their web server of choice. In the last few years however, many have migrated from Apache to [Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/docs/) due to performance benefits and better flexibility.

## Default settings
Nginx is already pre-configured for WordPress use in WP-palvelu. No need to follow guides online on how to set up Nginx with WordPress.

Our default Nginx configuration includes:

* Strong HTTPS settings ([see example](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=wp-palvelu.fi&s=185.26.50.22))
* A Let's Encrypt certificate for your public domains
* HTTP cache with [stale cache](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_cache_use_stale) configured
* Automatic expiration headers for static content
* The [Pagespeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/) module.
* User configurable API
* Gzip
* And lots more...

## Restarting Nginx

After making changes to your nginx configuration, please reload the configuration by running

```
wp-restart-nginx
```

If there are any errors `wp-restart-nginx` will warn you about them and refuse to restart before the issue is fixed.

## Configuration

In most generic Apache hosting platforms, you have the abilityu to use **.htaccess** files for adding custom rules to your web server. There are multiple reasons why this is not optimal, just to mention one, is the inherently slower execution time for all page loads.

Instead, we give our users access to their nginx configuration via a configuration directory, containing **.conf** files read by Nginx on startup. The configuration is under the following path:

```
/data/wordpress/nginx/custom.conf
```

> **Note:** Under the hood, your custom Nginx configuration is included like this:
>
> ```
> server {
>   listen 80 default_server;
>   server_name your-site.com;
>   ...
>
>   include /data/wordpress/nginx/*.conf;
>
>   ...
> }
> ```

## Examples
The default file: ```/data/wordpress/nginx/custom.conf``` includes a few examples to start with, disabled by comments.

### Forcing HTTPS

To force all your users to connect via https, you may redirect them to the https side via some Nginx configuration.

The preferred method to force HTTPS is via a custom variable.

```
# Force redirect http -> https
set $force_https 1;
```

### Redirects

#### Basic redirects
Redirects from http://your-site.com/original -> https://example.com/new/url/

```
rewrite "^/original(.*)$" "https://example.com/new/url$1" permanent;
```

#### Redirecting domains
If you have multiple domains for your site and want to only use one of them:

```
if ($host ~ "old-subdomain.your-old-site.com") {
  return 301 https://your-site.com$request_uri;
}
```

### The PageSpeed module
PageSpeed sniffs your html documents and rewrites them to be faster. This process is very site specific, so test everything carefully before enabling PageSpeed in production. You can find all filters in [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/filters).

#### Turn pagespeed on
```
pagespeed on;
```

#### Add some PageSpeed filters
```
# This does a lot so test which of these you really need
pagespeed EnableFilters rewrite_css,sprite_images,combine_css,inline_css,flatten_css_imports,inline_javascript,combine_javascript,inline_google_font_css,canonicalize_javascript_libraries,rewrite_images,recompress_images;
```
